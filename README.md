# IMAGE_ENCRYPTION
Image encryption is a process that transforms an image into an unreadable format to protect it from unauthorized access. This technique ensures that the original visual data is concealed and can only be viewed or restored by individuals with the correct decryption key.</br></br>
To work with image encryption, We need two libraries <b>pillow</b> and <b>cryptography</b>.</br>
1.Pillow is a popular Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork that provides easy-to-use methods for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It's widely used for image processing tasks.</br>
2.The cryptography library provides tools to secure and encrypt data in Python. It includes implementations of various cryptographic algorithms and protocols.</br></br>
define image_path and output_path. Run encryption program. It produces KEY and IV in hexadecimal format and encryption_image in the same repository. Place KEY and IV in the decryption file and run it. It produces the decryption_image in the same repository.
